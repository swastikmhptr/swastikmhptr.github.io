title: Leveraging Deep-Learning for Threat Estimation
description: This project aims to promote AI for Good by exploring the Global Terrorism Database created by the University of Maryland, curating it, and trying to map untraceable patterns between different terrorism incidents using Artificial Neural Networks. We used this setup to find out the vulnerability of various Indian states to possible criminal activities at different intervals of time. We developed the complete ANN training and inference set-up from scratch to better Learn Deep-Learning Technology.
