This Repository contains my Portfolio website which i will be constantly updating. It includes all the relevent details which i think will be needed to know me better. 
to design this website i have used jekyll as my website builder and SASS for my CSS formatting.
And i have also used particle.js and typed.js open source packages for my website.

In order to view the website go to https://swastikmhptr.github.io
