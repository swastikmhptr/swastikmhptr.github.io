I am a graduate student in Robotic Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon University, with 6+ years of experience in Machine Learning and Software Engineering for embedded devices.My professional experience at Analog Devices has equipped me with valuable skills in deep learning, computer vision, and embedded systems. Some of my key achievements include: 

1) Developing a highly efficient Deep Learning Edge Inference Framework for highly compute-constrained processors like Digital Signal Processors, which earned a US patent.

2) Leading a team to create an interface and inference framework for one of the world's most efficient AI microcontrollers MAX78002. 

3) Developing industrial robotic safety solutions using award-winning Time of Flight Sensor ADTF3175. 

4) Publishing 14 research papers, patents, and digital publications in deep learning, computer vision, and robotic perception. 

5) Receiving the prestigious ADI Top 10 Under 10 Award, recognizing my commendable contributions to the organization. 

My academic background in Computer Science Engineering, combined with my ongoing graduate studies in Robotic Systems Development, provides a strong foundation for tackling complex technical challenges. I am eager to apply my expertise in machine learning, computer Vision and embedded systems to contribute to the ever evolving field of Robotics.
